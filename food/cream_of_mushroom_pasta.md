I got this from [zephyr 7b beta](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-chat) lmao

## Ingredients:

- 8 oz fusilli or penne pasta
- 1 can (10.5 oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 8 oz sliced mushrooms
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley for garnish

## Instructions:

1. Cook the pasta according to package directions in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and sauté until softened and translucent, around 3-4 minutes.
3. Add the mushrooms and thyme to the skillet and cook until the mushrooms are browned and have released their liquid, approximately 7-8 minutes.
4. Stir in the condensed cream of mushroom soup and milk. Continue cooking the mixture, whisking constantly, until heated through and smooth.
5. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add cooked pasta to the skillet and toss with the sauce until fully coated.
6. Garnish with grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley. Serve immediately while still piping hot. Enjoy your creamy mushroom pasta!
