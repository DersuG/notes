## Blade mount jig
- hold CD in place while mounting blades
- ensure perfect alignment of blade axis lines

## Blade manufacturing
- carbon fiber layup on conic mandril
- [1-sided molds](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?122737-Inside-Story-June-2003)
    - shrinkwrap sticks but gets smoother blades
    - kitchen wrap is harder to put on but doesn't stick
    - maybe put kitchen wrap first, then shrinkwrap around it?
    - having an adjustable jig instead of a mold?
        - need to do each blade individually anyways

## Design process
- [How to Design Wind Turbine Blade Geometry for Optimal Aerodynamic Efficiency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CavfXOt3Dew)
- blades should have a straight edge or some sort of reference line to help alignment on the CD
