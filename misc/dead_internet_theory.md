## My thoughts
- Google's "potemkin village" is autonomously (for the most part) scraped from the internet itself. It brings certain sites to the surface.
- The rest of the internet still exists, but goes unseen by the vast majority of people the vast majority of the time. Google doesn't actively try to stop you from going there, but unless you go out of your way to try, you'll mostly stay in the potemkin village.
