# Vectors n stuff
- **vector independence:** vectors can be defined without an origin point or coordinate system

## Vector operations
- addition/subtraction:
  - add/subtract pairwise
- scalar-vector multiplication:
  - scale all components
- dot product:
  - sum of pairwise multiplications
  - 0 for orthognoal
  - 1 if parallel in same direction
  - -1 if parallel in opposite direction
  - $\abs{v} = \sqrt{v\dot{v}}$
- projection:
- cross product
  - given 2 orthogonal vectors, returns a 3rd orthogonal vector

## Coordinate systems
- origin
- **basis vectors:** set of linearly independent vectors
