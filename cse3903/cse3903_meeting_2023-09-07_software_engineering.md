# CSE3903: Software Engineering

## Technical documentation
- requirements analysis
    - requirements doc:
        - written from users' perspective
        - defines and limits the scope
        - contract between customer and developers
    - specification doc:
        - written from devs' perspective
        - basis for design, implementation, and testing
        - contract between devs and managers
- analyzing audience
    - audience profile:
        - knowledge/experience (novice, technician, expert, manager, etc.)
        - education + professional background
        - reading level
        - needs, objectives, motivations
        - values, biases, expectations
    - diverse audiences may need multiple documents or separate sections
    - audience profile: technical
    - audience profile: customers
        - task-oriented
        - necessary info
        - concise + simple
    - consider writing an explicit profile
        - e.g. The reader is expected to be familiar with...
- purpose
    - start with what you want
    - consider writing an explicit statement of purpose
 - prewriting
     - depth of cognition
         - **Bloom's taxonomy of cognition:** levels of how in-depth something is
             - knowledge
             - comprehension
             - application
             - analysis
             - synthesis
             - evaluation
     - 

### Proofreading
- read bottom to top, line by line
- change the font
- put it in a text-to-speech tool

### Writing style
- 1st vs. 2nd vs. 3rd person
- avoid passive voice (e.g. "the error is used by the loader to indicate..." < "the loader issues this error to indicate...")
- be concise
- "which" vs. "that"
    - just avoid "which"
    - do a which hunt
- "less" vs. "fewer"
- "utilize"
- grammar: dangling modifiers 

## Software crisis
- **software crisis:** hardware and software trending towards increasing capability and complexity
- tooling helps (CASE, analysis tools, programming languages, etc.)

## Well-designed code
- understandable
- modular
- traceable
- fixable
- modifiable
- extendable

## Development model: Waterfall
1. requirements analysis
2. system spec
3. design
4. implementation
5. testing
6. maintenance

- problems:
    - it's not this simple
    - can't design everything

## Alternative models
- heavy vs. lightweight
- OMT, Booch, Objectory, RUP
- Agile
    - rapid prototyping
    - continuously refining requirements
- test-driven development
    - write test cases first!
    - only write enough code to pass the tests!!
