# Assemblers

## Why assembly?
- easier than machine code

## Label field
- symbolic name for address
- often severely limited in length

## Segment definition
- name
- load address
- length
- initial execution address
- use pseudo-ops in the assembly to define them
    - length is automatically calculated

## Literals
