## The virtual machine
- memory
- cpu
- registers (PC, CCRs, general purpose)

## Memory
- sequence of `N` cells of `k` width
- 16-bit words (`k=16`, can't address second byte)

## Instruction cycle
- **IPC:** instruction processing cycle
    - fetch
        - copy memory at PC to CPU
        - then increment PC
    - decode
    - evaluate addresses
    - fetch operand
    - execute
    - store result
- in real systems:
    - fast as fuck
    - not all phases needed every time
    - sometimes phases can be combined
## Reduced instruction set (RISC)

## Pipelining
- doing sequential steps in parallel over different jobs
- no benefit for more pipelines than steps in IPC
- sometimes involves guesses (branch prediction?)
    - pipelines could depend on each other
    - if guess is wrong, must flush pipelines

## Concurrency
- multi cores, each still pipelined
- challenges:
    - figuring out what can be parallelized

## Instruction set architecture (ISA)

## Labs overview
- assembler (lab 2) -> linking loader (lab 3) -> simulator (lab 1)

## Lab 1
- input: text file ("object file")
    - describes initialization of memory chunks
    - header record, text records, end record)
- create simulator
    - initialize machine
    - load object file
    - simulate execution
- simulation has 3 modes:
    - quiet (no extra output)
    - trace (output state before/after execution + other stuff)
    - step (like trace, but pause after each execution)

### Milestones
- preliminary documentation (due 2023-09-19)
    - Programmer's Guide is super important
- mandatory design reviews
- completed documentation (due 2023-09-26)
- interactive grading

[!] Keep documentation updated! Don't procrastinate this shit!!!

### Instructions
- instructions are 16 bits, opcode is first 4 bits
- opcode followed by operands
- all instructions are the same size

### Addressing modes

#### Immediate addressing mode
- value is stored in the instruction itself

#### Register addressing mode
- instruction tells you what register to use

#### Direct addressing mode
- instruction tells you what address to use
- often combined with something else to get the actual address (e.g. page number, register, etc.)

#### Indirect addressing mode
- instruction tells you the address of the address to use
- like a pointer

#### Indexed addressing mode
- instruction tells you an offset to be added to the address
- often address is in a register
- **direct indexed:** address in operand + offset
- **register indexed:** address in register + offset

### VM design
- immediate, register, base-relative, direct, and indirect addressing modes
- instructions can have 1, 2, or 3 operands
- arithmetic, logical, load/store, branching, debug, and trap instructions
