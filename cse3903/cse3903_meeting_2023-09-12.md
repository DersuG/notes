# CSE 3903: Testing

## CRC cards
- class-responsibility-collaboration
- brainstorming tool
- index cards, 1 for each class
  - intentionally small to encourage KISS
- write verbs

## UML
- **unified modeling language (UML):** notation for describing software
  - rich standard
  - implementation and language neutral
  - diagrams are the most popular part
- give it a try!

### UML class diagram
- graph
  - nodes are classes/interfaces
  - arrows are relationships
    - association
    - inheritance
    - realization/implementation
    - dependency
    - aggregation
    - composition

### UML sequence diagram
- graph
  - nodes are objects/instances
- shows stuff over time
- good visual aid

### UML use-case diagram
- ??

## Testing
- increases confidence in an implementation
- testing can detect bugs, not the lack of them

## Theory of testing
- 3 levels of abstraction:
  - want (the idea)
  - have (the implementation)
  - testing requires comparing it against something, but what? (testing against idea is too fuzzy)
- **specification:** defines correct mapping between input and output
  - **function:** maps each element in domain to 1 element in range
    - deterministic
    - e.g. `find_factor()`
  - **relation:** maps each element in domain to >=1 element in range
    - nondeterministic
    - e.g. `shuffle()`
- **unit under test (UUT):** the thing being tested
- **black box testing:** testing only based on specification (tester doesn't look at code)
- **white box testing:** testing based on code structure (e.g. testing every branch)
- **integration testing:** testing combinations of modules (best done incrementally)
  - **bottom-up testing:** write low level modules, then use a higher level "driver" to test their integration
  - **top-down testing:** write top level modules, with stubs for low level modules
- **system tests:** check that the whole system meets the specifications
  - **alpha testing:** by devs, before release
  - **beta testing:** by friendly customers, before full release
  - **acceptance testing:** by end customer, to decide if they'll hire you again!

## Test-driven development
- in dynamic languages, testing is even more important
- "if it isn't tested, assume it doesn't work"
- write tests first (!!!)

## Testing frameworks/infrastructure
- automation
- **framework:** a library with gaps, programmer fills in the gaps to create a complete product

## JUnit
- bundled with Eclipse
- version 5 has major changes
- **test case:** tests a single unit of code/behavior/functionality
  - small
  - independent
  - public method marked with `@test`
- **test fixture:** tests a class
  - collection of test cases
- **test suite:** collection of test fixtures
- `@BeforeEach` methods initialize a fixture with a setup method (instead of the constructor)
  - better errors if a failure happens during setup
- anachronisms:
  - test names used to have to start with "test", avoid this
  - setup and teardown methods have been replaced with `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach`

### JUnit assertions
- `assertEquals()`
  - prefer over `assertTrue()`, as it gives better error messages
  - can provide a precision for comparing floats
- `assertTrue()`
- `assertFalse()`
- `assertNull()`
- `assertNotNull()`
- can parameterize `@test` with a timeout

## Misc
- run tests often
- consistent naming
- groupt tests in same package, but different source folder as the code (e.g. `vm/src/osu/cse/WritingStick.java` and `vm/test/osu/cse/WritingStickTest.java`
