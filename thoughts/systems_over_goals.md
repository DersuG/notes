# Systems > Goals
- **system:** something you do often (e.g. daily habit)
- goals leave you worrying, because at the end of most days, you haven't reached them
- systems leave you satisfied, because at the end of most days, you've accomplished something

## Daily TODOs
- a general TODO/task list isn't helpful because it's just a bunch of goals
    - it is good for tracking deadlines, just not for getting thing done
- a daily TODO/task list, made each morning, is probably more helpful because it's a system
    - but it's not good for tracking deadlines
- combined, they are powerful
