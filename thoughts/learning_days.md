# Learning Days
What if we set aside days to learn about certain topics? What if they happened often enough to matter but not so often as to be annoying? What if this attained critical mass and became a movement? What if there was a day where everyone read man pages? What if we learned about geology? What other things could we learn about? What if, by having some critical mass, we inspired each other to actively participate? What if we learned together, shared resources, mapped our research, and followed the trails of others?

i think that'd be pretty cool
