# Code as Magic

Get ready for the nerdiest shit you've ever seen.

Imagine a fantasy world, where magic must act through a sort of medium. Medium here doesn't mean something physical. It's more like the domain of what can be affected. Suppose our medium is called "ether".

In many fantasy worlds, their ether encompasses the whole world. Magic can interact with everything.

Suppose instead that the medium was more contained somehow. Maybe magic only works in the spirit realm? But there are ways for the spirit realm to interact with the physical realm, so magic does have some indirect power here.

Computing is to computers what magic is to ether. Our physical world has no magic, but we've created a medium for one. An ether of our own. Like Shadowrun's matrix.

Commands are like spells, programs like rituals, languages like scripts. We are witches and wizards, studying the arcane.

So be a good apprentice and memorize your spells, study your theory, practice your casting.
