# Feeler
We are bio-autonoma, and we are felt.
The feeler feels me just as it feels you too, along with the birds above.

It feels the act of remembrance, though it has no memory of its own.
Memory is in our separate minds; I cannot remember feeling you, neither can you remember feeling me.
Yet the feeler feels us both the same.

It feels the act of thought, though it cannot think on its own.
Really, we don't feel ourselves think. We remember ourselves thinking.

It feels our pain and our joy, though what is good or bad for us is not necessarily so for the feeler.
It just feels.

There's no meaningful distiction between what feels me and what feels you; we could say they're all the same.
It feels us.
