# Nonlinear Text

Text doesn't have to be linear. Examples of nonlinear text:

- zettelk√§sten / digital gardens
- wikis

## Graph poetry
- sections of text are arranged like a graph
    - text sections are the vertices
    - the edges (lines) may be directional
    - may be cyclic
- can be read in many ways
    - can leave a lot of interpretation up to the reader
    - can discover new orders
    - not every possible route has to make sense
    - who cares about grammar
    - the order of nodes guides the reader
        - most people will try to read top-down
        - can emphasize specific paths
        - reader still has the final say
    - you can even leave off the lines and set the reader truly free
- also, it just looks cool

### Making graph poetry in draw.io
1. add text in textboxes
2. set the perimeter shape of the textboxes to "ellipse"
3. size the perimeters of the textboxes to create an even margin around the text
4. add lines and connect them to textboxes (drag their endpoints to the center of the textbox, don't let it snap to its perimeter anchor points)
5. edit and rearrange the graph to your liking
