## Hot showers bad
- ruins your hair

### Irish showers
> "Irish showers to wake up (start warm, slowly bring temp down). Shampoo once every three showers (unless feelin gross). Fancy redhead conditioner + coconut butter every other shower (I have no soul). Consume shower rat daily. Mud mask AFTER shaving, then pore cleanse (when I remember to)." - kryptonaut

## Coconut butter
- helps long hair somehow
