## Asking ChatGPT
***are there epoxies that can be cured and uncured multiple times?***

While there are some epoxies that can be partially uncured and reworked, it is not typically possible to fully cure and then uncure an epoxy multiple times. Once an epoxy is fully cured, it becomes a thermosetting plastic, which means that the curing process irreversibly alters the chemical structure of the epoxy, making it rigid and strong.

However, some types of epoxies, such as thermoplastic epoxies, can be partially uncured and reshaped under certain conditions. These types of epoxies have a reversible curing process that allows them to be heated and reshaped multiple times without breaking down.

It's important to note that the ability to uncure and recure an epoxy multiple times depends on the specific formulation of the epoxy and the conditions under which it is cured and uncured. Some epoxies may be more amenable to this process than others, so it's important to carefully research the specific properties of any epoxy you plan to work with.

***what brands of epoxy can be reshaped like this***

There are several brands of thermoplastic epoxy that can be reshaped under certain conditions. Some examples of such brands are:

1.  Tg Composites: They offer a range of thermoplastic epoxies that can be reshaped multiple times. Their products are used in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and sports.
2.  Huntsman Advanced Materials: They offer a range of Araldite thermoplastic epoxy resins that can be reshaped by heating. Their products are used in various applications, including composite manufacturing and tooling.
3.  Entropy Resins: They offer a range of Super Sap thermoplastic epoxies that can be reshaped by heating. Their products are used in various industries, including surfboard and paddleboard manufacturing.

It's important to note that the specific properties and characteristics of each brand's thermoplastic epoxy may vary, so it's essential to research and test the product's properties before use.

***how hot do they have to be reheated to be reshaped?***

The temperature required to reshape a thermoplastic epoxy depends on the specific formulation of the epoxy and the extent to which it has been cured. Generally, the epoxy needs to be heated to a temperature above its glass transition temperature (Tg), which is the temperature at which the epoxy transitions from a hard, brittle state to a softer, more pliable state.

The Tg of a thermoplastic epoxy varies depending on the specific formulation, but it typically ranges between 50째C to 200째C (122째F to 392째F). To reshape a thermoplastic epoxy, it needs to be heated above its Tg but below its decomposition temperature, which is the temperature at which the epoxy begins to break down.

It's essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for heating and reshaping the epoxy to ensure that it's done safely and effectively. In general, the epoxy should be heated gradually and evenly to the desired temperature using an oven, heat gun, or other heating device. Once the epoxy has reached the desired temperature, it can be reshaped into the desired form using molds, presses, or other shaping tools.
