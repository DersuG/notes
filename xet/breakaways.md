# Breakaways

Working on any group programming project, it quickly becomes clear that most
people don't have much drive/motivation/initiative. This is ok if you have
someone in charge, meet often enough, and have good communication. Basically,
do Agile or something.

But most of the time, it's not like that. Some projects aren't suited to
micromanagement. Students are busy, can't meet every day. So what can we do?
Not much.

There are groups out there that are highly motivated. Their members are just
a little bit insane enough, and when put together they compound. You end up with
a group of people who genuinely care, who will put in the work. And they make
some of the coolest shit I've ever seen.

I call them "breakaway groups" because they're just going their own way, leaving
the rest of us in the dust.

I want to be insane like this. It's possible to catch up, but I can't do it
alone. I need to find other insane people. If you're insane, please 74 61 6C 6B
