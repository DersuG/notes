# Tab Hoarding
- why?
    - to store information / access to information
    - can store information in notes instead
        - make a habit of using notes when researching
    - for non-research stuff, store them in a bookmarks folder
        - loading and unloading will take longer
        - good time to purge non-critical stuff
        - needs to not interfere with important bookmarks

## Tab hoarding is a deficiency in knowledge storage
- having notes about a topic with links to pages is better than just keeping those pages open in your browser
    - those tabs eat ram
    - notes give more insight
    - notes don't *really* take much more effort
    - links in your notes are much more likely to be revisited, whereas tabs you keep around typically aren't!
- notice how you can *close those tabs* after noting them down, *without fear!*
- notes give more context anyways
- this is the perfect way to build up a zettelkasten-like note folder

## Research tabs vs. media tabs vs. todo tabs
- research tabs belong in notes
    - these pages on NACK i've been keeping around belong in notes
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACK-Oriented_Reliable_Multicast
        - https://www.nrl.navy.mil/Our-Work/Areas-of-Research/Information-Technology/NCS/NORM/
- media tabs can be mass-stored in a bookmarks folder
    - don't let it get out of hand, triage harshly, purge often
    - neocities pages
    - music on youtube
    - cool games i might buy (but probably not because i'm broke)
        - [Saccharine Pale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2314090/Saccharine_Pale/)
    - if it's a meme or something, send it to a friend. you can find it again later if you need to (you won't)
- todo tabs are usually media tabs acting as a todo list
    - i've been keeping the wikipedia page on [Ergo Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy) open because i want to watch it at some point
    - they belong in an actual todo list

## Tools
- [Copy Selected Tab Info](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-selected-tab-info/)
    - can format as a markdown list of links!!!
    - can't mass-reopen them though
    - best used as just a note-taking convenience
- a local markdown editor browser extension?
    - obsidian is too heavy
    - something compact and light
    - still want a file browser in it though, opening up a third window for a file explorer is too much
