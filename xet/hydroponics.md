# Hydroponics
- [Cheap Hydroponics in a Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ewOsgoGQL4)
    - cycling the pump is ideal (1 min on, 3 mins off)
- [Cheap DIY Grow Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXWM3u2jpAE)
    - for germination
- [Rockwool for Hydroponics](https://lovefromourbackyard.com/how-to-use-rockwool-in-hydroponics/)
    - reasonably reuseable (~6 times, must be sterilized)
    - [Reusing Rockwool](https://plantprovider.com/can-you-reuse-rockwool-for-hydroponics/)
    - rockwool downsides
        - [Rockwool is Harmful](https://www.epicgardening.com/rockwool-harmful/)
        - potentially carcinogenic!
        - unnatural, non-biodegradeable
        - non-renewable
        - supply-chain dependent

- [Alternative Growing Mediums](https://www.epicgardening.com/hydroponic-growing-media/)

## Wick systems
- no moving parts
- stupid easy
- cheap (potentially doesn't depend on supply chains!)
- less efficient
- wicks can get clogged or oversaturated
- [Hydroponic Wick Systems](https://www.thespruce.com/hydroponic-gardens-wick-system-1939222)
- wick material:
    - nylon rope
    - wool rope
    - yarn and stuff

## Nutrient film technique
- also called NFT ðŸ¤®
- [Nutrient Film Technique](https://www.thespruce.com/hydroponic-gardens-nutrient-film-technique-1939220)
- constant water flow
- no growing medium needed
- doesn't require electricity
    - 2 reservoirs
    - source resorvoir placed high up
    - gravity does the job
    - must manually move water back up
- top-heavy plants (ie. tomatoes) require support (ie. trellises)
- cylindrical channels are inefficient
    - roots in middle get most nutrients
    - uneven growth
- flat-bottomed channels are best
- maybe there's a way to distribute the water flow even better?

## Kratky Method
- [Kratkey Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTWBvQboSFY)
- no pump, no electricity
- passive (mostly)
- conceptually simple
- needs changes to work with heavier plants like tomatoes
- having a wire mesh below the cups significantly stimulates root growth
- needs airflow
    - [see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq4xxUl_40o)
    - flettner ventilater?
    - savonius turbine outside drives a fan inside? [[wind_power]]
    - airflow allows faster osmosis of water in leaves
    - seedlings don't have the waxy layer that protects against excess water loss, so they need less airflow

## Plant type
- [Best Plants for Hydroponics](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-plants-hydroponically-1939234)
- solution-based systems:
    - nutrient film technique / aeroponics systems
    - fast growing
    - shallow roots
    - lettuce, spinach, radishes, and herbs
- medium-based systems:
    - wick / ebb-and-flow systems
    - growing medium provides support
    - deep roots
    - top heavy
    - comfrey, chicory, and beets
    - beans, tomatoes, squash, and cucumbers

## Nutrient solution
- most are supply-chain dependent

### Hydroponic Nutrient Mix Formula #3 â€“ Compost Tea Recipe
This is the first homemade nutrient mix that can be classed as organic. It takes a little more effort than others take, but if you have spare space, then it can really give your plants a growth boost.

The first thing you will need is a compost heap or even better a composting bin. These should be outdoors in case there are any fumes.

1.  When making a compost heap, you should be looking at using half-green waste and half-brown waste. Green waste includes grass cuttings, green leaves, food waste from the kitchen. The brown waste side includes straw or hay, dead leaves, old papers (not shiny magazine paper), wood chippings.
2.  When you have your heap, turn this every few weeks so all the materials can break down and the bacteria will do its work.
3.  When your compost is ready, all you need to do is add two large shovels full to a large 5-gallon bucket. Fill this with water and let it steep for three days.
4.  If you have access to aquarium water all the better, if not try to avoid any chemically treated water. Rainwater is also a good option so begin harvesting when it rains.
5.  Once your mixture has been **soaking for three days**, all you need to do is pour out the liquid and strain it to remove all traces of your compost sediment. This sediment can be added back on your compost heap.
6.  When it comes to using this liquid, you need to use 1/2 a gallon for every 50 gallons of water in your tank.

While this is good enough to use on its own, you can also add some of the next two recipes or some of the homemade fertilizer or growth booster.
```

Additives:
- egg shells (calcium)
    - grind 6 with a pestle + mortar
    - add to 1.5 liters of water
    - add a few drips of diluted hydrochloric acid
    - leave for 24 hours
    - filter out solids
- bananna skins (potassium)
    - boil 3-4 bananna skins in 1 liter of water
    - add a little sugar or molassas
    - remove skins
    - use during flowering stage for ~20% boosted growth!
- coffee grounds
    - contains bacteria with nitrogen
    - either add them to compost
    - or soak in water for 24 hours

## Leaf compost
- [Leaf Compost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4OCa9QQPJ0)
- mulched leaves will compost much faster than full leaves
- leaves alone aren't nutritious enough, need to add other things
    - compost
    - manure
- barrel needs air holes
    - holes in bottom to allow worms in
- still should add regular dirt (for microbes) and manure
- instead of manure, using JADAM JMS, leaves can break down in a week!

## JADAM JMS
- [JADAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIRvmA2Gkgs)
- using diverse microorganisms to enrich soil nutrient diversity
- best source of microorganisms is the base of the closest mountain
- get leafmold soil from under fallen leaves
- mix with water
- add boiled potatoes and salt
- leave for 1-3 days
- use when foaming maxes out
- water the soil/medium before transplanting
- submerge seedlings for 2-3 mins before transplanting
- the diversity actually prevents infections caused by too much of a single organism
- adding the same kind of plant (tomatoes for tomato plants) helps grow specific microorganisms best for that plant
