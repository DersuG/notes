# Flatgames
> Flatgames are predominantly 2D games revolving around the [exploration](https://glitchwave.com/games/genre/exploration/) of a field, with minimal if no interactivity whatsoever. There are zero gameplay mechanics beyond movement and animation, and are often made extremely quickly. They can often employ personal or evocative narratives by the developers themselves, using the game as a vessel towards telling a story. The visuals can be handmade, using drawings, photographs or other pieced-together media that encompasses a distinctive DIY look.
