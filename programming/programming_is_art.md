# Programming is Art
- There isn't a perfect way to do everything, much is left to you.
- Especially smaller details, like the individual formatting of lines.
- Or where to put empty lines / how to group lines of code.
- Or how to comment things.
- They do matter for code comprehension, maintainability, onboarding, etc.
- Standardization can only get you so far.
- Beautiful code is like a beautiful painting.
- Even the tiny details are elegant.
- Be an artist, not a machine.
