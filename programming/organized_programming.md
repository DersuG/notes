# Organized Programming

## On-Boarding
- topic guides
	- like research logs, but more linear and explanatory
- tutorial videos
- hands-on labs/demos (in-person)
- set aside time for troubleshooting (in-person)

## Documents
- design doc
- history / timeline
	- doesn't have to be a doc, could be auto-generated by timestamps of other docs
- decision doc
- record of investigation / incident record
- research log
	- like a study guide
	- a map for the next person to follow
- meeting notes
	- every meeting
	- by a different person each time
- extended commit messages
	- when in doubt, explain everything

## From Zero to Bureaucracy
- implement gradually
	- start with meeting notes and design docs
	- research logs can be converted to topic guides
