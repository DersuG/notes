# Git
- git is *really* useful. It lets you:
    - archive old versions of stuff
    - have many people work on a project at once
    - go back in time when you break something
    - work on many features separately, without conflicting, as if you were working on one at a time
- git is also ugly:
    - ten million weird words
    - arcane wizard commands in the terminal
    - sometimes it breaks
    - StackOverflow answers kinda suck a lot
- It's still worth it.
## Basic concepts
- **repo/repository:** a copy of the project
- **branch:** a timeline
