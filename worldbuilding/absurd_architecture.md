# Absurd Architecture

## Bottomless sink

I enter the bathroom. There is no mirror on the wall behind the sink. I step closer. There is no sink. Only a shaft descending into nothingness. I peer into it. Even as I am firmly grounded, I tremble with fear. Fear that I should fall in.

The toilet is the same. A circular shaft in a marble block. There is no seat - it makes no difference.

So is the shower. There is no drain. Only a bottomless trough at one end. Big enough for me.
