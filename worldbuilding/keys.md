# keys
Keys are concepts that have interesting effects related to ARRA ([[arra]]).

Keys are found through coincedence or brute force.

The L0 string keys are:
- illix
- nuanceless
- w47ch
- 7h15157h3k3y
- 75 69 89

Keys can come in many forms. The most common are:
- strings/phrases
- glyphs/symbols
- color combinations (?)
- musical phrases
- specific sounds

It is possible that keys will stop working at some point. However, if they stop working in the future, then it is likely that they would stop working in the past, too. Either:
- modifying the past is a paradox
- ARRA can't modify the past, but instead replace it with a new past
or
- modifying the past is not always possible
In either case, there may be ways to detect and subvert the effects.
