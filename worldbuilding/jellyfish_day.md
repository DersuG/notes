## Jellyfish Day
- Billions of jellyfish rise from the waters and float through the air.
- Apocalyptic consequences
- They are still as dangerous as they usually are
- It's uncanny to see
	- They are silent, delicate, dangerous
	- They fill the air
	- The suddenness of the halt in human affairs because of such an absurd and strange event
- They start getting tangled up in places
	- Infrastructure falters
-
