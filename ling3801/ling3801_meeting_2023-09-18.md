# Writing Systems
- writing system â‰  language
- depending on the structure of the language, some writing systems might fit better than others

## Alphabets
- symbols represent sounds (consonants and vowels)

## Abjads
- symbols represent consonants only
- great for languages like arabic and hebrew where words are formed around modified roots

## Abugidas
- vowels are diacritics attached to consonant symbols
- e.g. hindi

## Syllabaries
- symbols represent syllables
- e.g. hirigana + katakana
- not good if you have many different syllable types (CV, VC, CVC, etc.)
- syllable coda, nucleus, etc?

## Logographic systems
- symbols represent words
- **pictogram:** a symbol that looks like what it means

## Writing directions
- left to right: english, russian, greek
- right to left: arabic, hebrew
- top to bottom: chinese, japanese (traditionally)
- **boustrophedon:** alternating direction each line
    - "ox-turning method"
    - method to cover a wall with text
    - many ancient languages

## Representing sounds
- **orthography:** the official spelling used in a language
- **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):** universal alphabet representation of sounds

## Egyptian hieroglyphs
- hieroglyphs were used on monuments and tombs
- hieretic was a simplified system for everyday use
    - eventually replaced by demotic
    - later replaced by coptic
    - later replaced by arabic
- **Athanasius Kircher:** one of the first to attempt decipherment
    - assumed they were pictograms, which they weren't
