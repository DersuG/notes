## Different ciphers vs. different keys
- changing the system is expensive and slow
- changing keys is cheap and fast

## Information theory

### Redundancy
- information compression

### Measuring information
- can be measured by # of guesses
- **Claude Shannon's uncertainty:** how many yes/no questions do you need to figure out the answer
-**Shannon entropy:** is the average # of questions 
    - measured in bits
    - on average, English has between 0.6 to 1.3 bits per character

### Entropy in cryptology
- monoalphabetic ciphers in English are easy to crack because the ciphertext has low entropy
- entropy is maximized when the letter frequency distribution is uniform
    - can increase security by making ciphertext more random

### Unicity distance

## Conclusion
- cryptoanalysis exploits statistical patters in the ciphertext
